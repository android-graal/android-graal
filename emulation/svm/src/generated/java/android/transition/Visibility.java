 * This transition tracks changes to the visibility of target views in the

 * views exist in the current view hierarchy. The class is intended to be a
 * utility for subclasses such as {@link Fade}, which use this visibility
 * information to determine the specific animations to run when visibility
 * changes occur. Subclasses should implement one or both of the methods
 * {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, int, TransitionValues, int)},
 * {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, int, TransitionValues, int)} or
 * {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, View, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)},
 * {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, View, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}.
