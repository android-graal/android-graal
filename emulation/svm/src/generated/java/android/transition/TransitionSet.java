/**
 * A TransitionSet is a parent of child transitions (including other
 * TransitionSets). Using TransitionSets enables more complex
 * choreography of transitions, where some sets play {@link #ORDERING_TOGETHER} and
 * others play {@link #ORDERING_SEQUENTIAL}. For example, {@link AutoTransition}
 * uses a TransitionSet to sequentially play a Fade(Fade.OUT), followed by
 * a {@link ChangeBounds}, followed by a Fade(Fade.OUT) transition.
 *
 * <p>A TransitionSet can be described in a resource file by using the
 * tag <code>transitionSet</code>, along with the standard
 * attributes of {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionSet} and
 * {@link android.R.styleable#Transition}. Child transitions of the
 * TransitionSet object can be loaded by adding those child tags inside the
 * enclosing <code>transitionSet</code> tag. For example, the following xml
 * describes a TransitionSet that plays a Fade and then a ChangeBounds
 * transition on the affected view targets:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     &lt;transitionSet xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 *             android:transitionOrdering="sequential"&gt;
 *         &lt;fade/&gt;
 *         &lt;changeBounds/&gt;
 *     &lt;/transitionSet&gt;
 * </pre>
