/**
 * <strong>[icu enhancement]</strong> ICU's replacement for {@link java.util.Locale}.&nbsp;Methods, fields, and other functionality specific to ICU are labeled '<strong>[icu]</strong>'.
 *
 * A class analogous to {@link java.util.Locale} that provides additional
 * support for ICU protocol.  In ICU 3.0 this class is enhanced to support
 * RFC 3066 language identifiers.
 *
 * <p>Many classes and services in ICU follow a factory idiom, in
 * which a factory method or object responds to a client request with
 * an object.  The request includes a locale (the <i>requested</i>
 * locale), and the returned object is constructed using data for that
 * locale.  The system may lack data for the requested locale, in
 * which case the locale fallback mechanism will be invoked until a
 * populated locale is found (the <i>valid</i> locale).  Furthermore,
 * even when a populated locale is found (the <i>valid</i> locale),
 * further fallback may be required to reach a locale containing the
 * specific data required by the service (the <i>actual</i> locale).
 *
 * <p>ULocale performs <b>'normalization'</b> and <b>'canonicalization'</b> of locale ids.
 * Normalization 'cleans up' ICU locale ids as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>language, script, country, variant, and keywords are properly cased<br>
 * (lower, title, upper, upper, and lower case respectively)</li>
 * <li>hyphens used as separators are converted to underscores</li>
 * <li>three-letter language and country ids are converted to two-letter
 * equivalents where available</li>
 * <li>surrounding spaces are removed from keywords and values</li>
 * <li>if there are multiple keywords, they are put in sorted order</li>
 * </ul>
 * Canonicalization additionally performs the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>POSIX ids are converted to ICU format IDs</li>
 * <li>Legacy language tags (marked as “Type: grandfathered” in BCP 47)
 * are converted to ICU standard form</li>
 * </ul>
 * All ULocale constructors automatically normalize the locale id.  To handle
 * POSIX ids, <code>canonicalize</code> can be called to convert the id
 * to canonical form, or the <code>canonicalInstance</code> factory method
 * can be called.
 *
 * <p>Note: The <i>actual</i> locale is returned correctly, but the <i>valid</i>
 * locale is not, in most cases.
