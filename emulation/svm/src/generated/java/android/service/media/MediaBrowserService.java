 * Base class for media browser services.
 * <p>
 * Media browser services enable applications to browse media content provided by an application
 * and ask the application to start playing it. They may also be used to control content that
 * is already playing by way of a {@link MediaSession}.
 * </p>
 *
 * To extend this class, you must declare the service in your manifest file with
 * an intent filter with the {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action.
 *
 * For example:
 * </p><pre>
 * &lt;service android:name=".MyMediaBrowserService"
 *          android:label="&#64;string/service_name" >
 *     &lt;intent-filter>
 *         &lt;action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
 *     &lt;/intent-filter>
 * &lt;/service>
 * </pre>
