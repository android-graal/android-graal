/**
 * A toast is a view containing a quick little message for the user.  The toast class
 * helps you create and show those.
 * {@more}
 *
 * <p>
 * When the view is shown to the user, appears as a floating view over the
 * application.  It will never receive focus.  The user will probably be in the
 * middle of typing something else.  The idea is to be as unobtrusive as
 * possible, while still showing the user the information you want them to see.
 * Two examples are the volume control, and the brief message saying that your
 * settings have been saved.
 * <p>
 * The easiest way to use this class is to call one of the static methods that constructs
 * everything you need and returns a new Toast object.
 * <p>
 * Note that
 * <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/material/snackbar/Snackbar">Snackbars</a> are
 * preferred for brief messages while the app is in the foreground.
 * <p>
 * Note that toasts being sent from the background are rate limited, so avoid sending such toasts
 * in quick succession.
 * <p>
 * Starting with Android 12 (API level 31), apps targeting Android 12 or newer will have
 * their toasts limited to two lines.
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
